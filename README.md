## Purpose
This is a centralized repository for assorted personal projects that, if I made a repository for all of them, would create unwanted clutter.

## Contributing
don't

## Contents
1. `celebi` is a Flask API which acts as a proxy to host "Lambda" functions that I don't want to put on AWS
2. `sunflora` is a makeshift frontend that hosted a game I made for a Games Studies class in Winter 2025, and later might become a compiler that compiles some text-representation of a text-based game (e.g. a Markdown file, or a folder of them) into a React app with support for calling APIs
3. `chimecho` is a o3-mini written CLI that converts Markdown schedules into a png and html calendar
4. `espeon` is a Python interface to interact with an ESP-300 translation stage controller via USB instead of RS232 and abstract away the need to manually read and write bytes
