## Purpose
This is a centralized repository for some meaningful personal projects that, if I made a repository for all of them, would create unwanted clutter. Some older and smaller projects are on the `some-old-projects` branch, though they are small, trivial, and frankly useless.

## Contents
1. `celebi` is a Flask API which acts as a proxy to host "Lambda" functions that I don't want to put on AWS.
2. `sunflora` is a makeshift frontend that hosted a game I made for a Games Studies class in Winter 2025. A future goal here is to build a compiler to transform folders of Markdown files and human-readable LLM API calls into a page-based text game through programatically generating React code.
3. `espeon` is a Python interface to interact with an ESP-300 translation stage controller via USB instead of RS232 and abstract away the need to manually read and write bytes through human-readable functions.
4. `sealeo` is a C++ parallel programming project to reimplement channels and routines from the Go runtime in C++, with the intent to build scheduling and thread abstractions from the ground up.
5. `meloetta` is an OCaml compiler from Markdown to React as a text-based game engine that supports LLMs and API calls to democratise the creation of text-based games powered by language models.
