## Purpose
This is a centralized repository for assorted API endpoints that are too sporadically used to be serverless Lambda functions, and too useless to be their own repository.

## Contributing
don't

## Contents
`celebi` is a Flask API. It contains
1. Twine game API
The API for an LLM-based game where the player plays as an anonymous Asian-American character that needs to respond to LLM-generated prompts of a racist white man who (true story) sat next to me on a flight from Minneapolis to Amsterdam.

2. Wildhacks email API
The API for the email list for Wildhacks, Northwestern's largest student-run hackathon, for the year 2025.
