# Twine Game: Whitesplaining

If you are reading this, you are probably trying to set up this game for hosting. I recommend you push this to a Github repository and then create an app on DigitalOcean. It will do most of the work for you. To run locally, install NodeJS and then
```
bun install
```
and then
```
bun dev
```
I will probably clean up this file at some point in the future.
