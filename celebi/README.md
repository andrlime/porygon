# Celebi
A folder of assorted singleton Flask API endpoints that are too small to host individually, but too non-trivial to just throw into a serverless Lambda function and say goodbye forever to. Run using the provided Docker images, or write your own. The prod run command is in the Taskfile.

Running commands in the Taskfile assumes you have Taskfile and Poetry installed.
